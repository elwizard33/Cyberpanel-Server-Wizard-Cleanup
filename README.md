# CyberPanel Server Wizard Cleanup Scripts

### Overview

These scripts are designed to help identify and clean potential malware and ransomware infections on CyberPanel servers. There are two versions available: the Basic version and the Advanced version. Both perform diagnostics to detect malicious files, suspicious processes, and encrypted files, followed by appropriate cleanup and decryption processes.

### Features of Both Scripts

- **Automated Diagnostics**: Identify malicious files, suspicious processes, and encrypted files.
- **Cleanup of Malicious Artifacts**: Remove detected malicious files and terminate suspicious processes.
- **Ransomware Decryption**: Attempt to decrypt files encrypted with known ransomware extensions.
- **Wizard-Themed Interface**: Engage users with an intuitive, themed experience guiding them through the cleanup process.

### Advanced Version Features

- **User Interaction**: Prompts users for confirmation before executing critical cleanup tasks, ensuring control over actions.
- **Detailed User and Key Auditing**: Scans for suspicious users and SSH keys, providing a detailed report of potential security threats.
- **Enhanced Security Recommendations**: Offers additional security measures to consider after cleanup.
- **Ensures Root Privileges**: Confirms the script is run with appropriate permissions for effective operation.

### Detailed Differences Between Versions

- **User Confirmation**: 
  - *Basic*: Executes tasks with minimal user input, focusing on efficiency.
  - *Advanced*: Interactively prompts the user for confirmations at critical steps to ensure actions align with user intent.
  
- **Malicious User and Key Checks**: 
  - *Basic*: Does not check for suspicious users or SSH keys.
  - *Advanced*: Includes comprehensive checks for unauthorized users and unexpected SSH keys, asking the user for validation.
  
- **Security Recommendations Post-Cleanup**:
  - *Basic*: Focuses on the immediate cleanup.
  - *Advanced*: Provides additional security tips post-cleanup, such as password changes and firewall adjustments.

### Decrypting Scripts

- **`.psaux` Files**: Decrypted using [1-decrypt.sh](https://gist.github.com/gboddin/d78823245b518edd54bfc2301c5f8882/raw/d947f181e3a1297506668e347cf0dec24b7e92d1/1-decrypt.sh).
- **`.encryp` Files**: Decrypted using [encryp_dec.out](https://github.com/v0idxyz/babukencrypdecrytor/raw/c71b409cf35469bb3ee0ad593ad48c9465890959/encryp_dec.out).

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have `curl`, `wget`, and `bash` available on your system.
- **Take a Snapshot**: If youâ€™re using a virtual machine, take a snapshot before you start to safeguard against unintended consequences.
- Follow cybersecurity best practices by backing up your data prior to running the scripts.
