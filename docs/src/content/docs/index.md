description: Overview of the Cyberzard AI-assisted CyberPanel security CLI
---

Welcome to Cyberzard. This guide teaches you how to secure and triage a CyberPanel server using an AI‑assisted CLI.

## What Cyberzard Does
Cyberzard accelerates incident triage by combining deterministic scanners (processes, files, cron, users, SSH keys) with an optional constrained ReAct agent that can summarize and advise without arbitrary shell access.

## Feature Highlights
| Area | Capability | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Scanning | Process / file IOC checks | Fast, read‑only collection |
| Remediation | Structured action plans | Human approval first |
| AI Assist | Summaries, prioritization | Provider optional (offline safe) |
| Safety | Tool allowlist, step cap | No raw shell exposed |
| Chat | Interactive, permission‑aware | See [Chat mode](./chat/) |

Next: Read the [Installation](./installation) page, then try the [Chat mode](./chat/).
