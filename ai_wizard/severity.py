"""Severity scoring & classification utilities.

Provides a lightweight heuristic classifier used when scanners
produce a raw indicator string but do not assign a contextual
severity yet, or when we want to normalize / escalate based on
indicator content.

The logic is intentionally simple & transparent (no ML) so that
security operators can audit / adjust. Adjust weight maps as the
project evolves.
